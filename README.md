# pose-pipelines

From Sarah's email:

>  The aim would be for us to set up a pose extraction pipeline ourselves so that we donâ€™t need to rely as much on our colleagues in Surrey anymore in the future. Apart from OpenPose and Holistic, Monocular Total Capture (Xiang et al., 2018) and FrankMoCap (Rong et al., 2021) may also be alternatives. Our colleagues at Surrey ultimately trained a HRNet (J. Wang et al., 2020) model and fine-tuned it on sign language data.
